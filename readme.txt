A microservices framework built in Java, using multi-threaded programming with Object oriented programming style in mind.
This framework lets the user (the programmer using the framework) define different microservices, and a certain running flow and running it.
These microservices can communicate with each other (using efficient asynchronous technics), and act according to their defined behavior and the information they receive from the other micro-services.

In addition to the framework itself, there is an example code for using the framework.
This example program is simulating an organized attack of the "resistance" from the Star Wars movies.
Each of the different characters is a micro-services with a different job, and together, with good old-fashioned multi threaded programming they execute their attack and save the universe.
